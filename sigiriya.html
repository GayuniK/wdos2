            <h1>About Sigiriya</h1> 

            <p>Perched on a slab of rock that juts dramatically over the forests of central Sri Lanka, 

                 Sigiriya is as imposing a sight now as it must have been when it was first built by a 

                  fierce king in the fifth century A.D. Meaning “lion’s rock,” Sigiriya 

                   (designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982) is accessed by way of 

                    passageways cut into the rock face between a monumental pair of lion paws.</p> 

 

                <p>The fortress was later swallowed by the forest, and only familiar to local villagers. 

                     Outsiders used knowledge of its past, preserved in Buddhist texts, to search for 

                      the ancient site. British historians rediscovered its astonishing buildings and 

                       frescoes in the 19th century.</p>

            <p>The Mahavamsa, a fifth-century Sri Lankan epic, tells how the Indian prince Vijaya 

                 was the grandson of a lion. He traveled to the island of Sri Lanka and married  

                 Princess Kuveni. From their union was born the Sinhalese race  

                 (sinhala means “of lions”). In the Sinhalese tradition, the lion is the mythical 

                  ancestor of kings and a symbol of royal authority. The photograph shows what remains  

                  of the monumental Lion Paws Gate at Sigiriya.</p>

            <img src="WDOS2 images/heritage/Sigiriya-Frescoes.jpeg" alt="sigiri lalnawo" class="responsive" style="width:100%"> 

            <p>Graffiti left by medieval travelers to Sigiriya are responses to the 

                 site’s extraordinary rock paintings depicting beautiful 

                  women dancing and bearing offerings. 

                   One notes: “The caress of the gentle breeze was delicate upon their bodies, 

                    illuminated by the light of the moon’s rays.” Historians have differed as 

                     to the identity of the women represented high up on the cliff wall. 

                      Their solid and sensual forms have led some writers to believe 

                       they are depictions of women from Kashyapa’s harem. 

                       Another theory believes them to be depictions of apsaras, 

                        singers and dancers in Indian mythology who inhabit heaven.</p>
